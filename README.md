# SW-Architecture-Learning - Plan to Become a Software Architect

## **Phase 1: Software Architecture Fundamentals**  
**Objective:** Understand core principles, patterns, and best practices.  

### **Topics to Study**  
- SOLID principles  
- Design patterns (GoF: Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)  
- Monolithic vs. distributed architectures  
- Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture  
- REST vs. GraphQL  
- Introduction to Cloud Computing (basic concepts, service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)  

### **Practice:**  
- Refactor a small application to apply SOLID principles.  
- Build a simple REST service using Node.js/Express or NestJS and apply Clean Architecture.  

### **Resources:**  
- *Clean Architecture* - Robert C. Martin  
- *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* - Gamma et al.  
- [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/)

## **Phase 2: Enterprise Application Architecture**  
**Objective:** Design and understand scalable applications.  

### **Topics to Study**  
- Layered architectures (n-tier, MVC)  
- Microservices: Principles, benefits, and challenges  
- API Gateway and Service Mesh  
- Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ)  
- Relational vs. NoSQL databases  
- Security in architecture (OAuth, JWT, CORS, CSRF)  

### **Practice:**  
- Build a backend with microservices using NestJS or Spring Boot.  
- Implement an API Gateway with Kong or AWS API Gateway.  

### **Resources:**  
- *Building Microservices* - Sam Newman  
- *Cloud Native Patterns* - Cornelia Davis  
- [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/)

## **Phase 3: Cloud Architecture and DevOps**  
**Objective:** Design cloud-based architectures and automate deployments.  

### **Topics to Study**  
- AWS Core Services: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, API Gateway  
- Containers: Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, EKS  
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation  
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps  
- Observability: Logging, monitoring, tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)  

### **Practice:**  
- Deploy an application on AWS using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.  
- Automate deployment with Terraform and GitHub Actions.  

### **Resources:**  
- *Cloud Architecture Patterns* - Bill Wilder  
- [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)  
- [Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)

## **Phase 4: Advanced Architecture and System Design**  
**Objective:** Design highly scalable, high-performance systems.  

### **Topics to Study**  
- Designing for high availability and scalability  
- CQRS and Event Sourcing architectures  
- Eventual consistency and CAP theorem  
- Edge Computing and Serverless  
- Hybrid and multi-cloud architectures  

### **Practice:**  
- Design and document the architecture of a complex system (e-commerce, social network, etc.).  
- Implement CQRS with an event system using Kafka or EventBridge.  

### **Resources:**  
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)  
- [Google Cloud Architecture Center](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/)  
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* - Martin Kleppmann
